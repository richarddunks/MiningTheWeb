<p> Keeping up with the theme of "Save Harlem Now!", I realised that despite its rich history and reputation, I know little to nothing about the neighborhood. I wanted to get a better feel for what the actual zoning is like to understand why some new development is labeled as being out of place. I used NYC open Data to obtain a list of building heights by floor count just to get a basic idea for what the buiding codes historicaly have been. I also went ahead and included a series of points on the map which represent a variety of facilities in the neighborhood. I included this to see if perhaps there were other indicators for Harlem's gentrification aside from the cheaper price of rent and accessibility.

    Unfortunately, I do not feel my data and visualization gets the point across very well. My biggest issue was translating data to the map in a way that could be easy for anyone to understand. But with the Facilities I had trouble labeling each facility type so as of right now they are merely points on the map with data pertaining to literal zoning (i.e. community area numbers, facility numbers rather than type, etc. etc.). The only thing I feel went right was the very basic chloropleth of building heights, which gave me a better feel for the physical landscape of the general area and why new high rises do indeed stick out like sore thumbs. </p>
