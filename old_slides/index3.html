#Assignment 1 - Project
###Create another visualization that either improves on your initial visualization with more/better data or uses different sets of data. The visualization should incorporate at least 2 datasets and tell some interesting story, using a more sophisticated visual style that incorporates the elements of good design discussed in class. Discuss the datasets used, the visual design of the visualization, and why you found the data compelling in a short text description of the project.

---

#Assignment 2 - Visualization Critique
###Find an interesting or visually compelling visualization online and write 2-3 paragraphs on the visualization, discussing the data source(s), the visual style, and how well the data was represented. Feel free to use the visualization resources listed above. Submit your text to the class page following the example shown.
